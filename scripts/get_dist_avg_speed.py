# description: 
# This node is a server node subscribing to the /act_pos_vel topic (from which it receives the current position and velocity of the simulated robot). When a request is received this node provides the
# requester with the current distance fromthe target and the average velocity. the server can be called from the /Dist_avg_speed service

# This function is a callback for the /act_pos_vel topic and receives the custom message Pos_vel. When called it stores the current x and y positions in two global variables and adds the current velocity's
# components to two lists of size w, removing the first values inserted in the list if the list contains more than avg_win element

# \brief service request callback function
# \param receives the custom service message Distance_AvgSpeed, empty on the request side

#
# this function is called whenever a service request is received. When called the distance from the target and the average speed are computed (both split in their x and y components) and sent to the 
# requester through the response to the request
