# description: 
# This node is a server providing, when requested, the last target position sent to the bug 0 action server. The requests and the responses are sent through the /get_last_target service using the Last_target custom service message

##
# \brief service request callback function
# \param receives the custom service message Last_target, empty on the request side
# \return returns the x-y coordinates of the last target requested to the bug 0 actionserver
# this function is called when a request is sent to the node, and the target position's coordinates are read from ROS' parameter server and sent back to the caller

#when called the server does this
